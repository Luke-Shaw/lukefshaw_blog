<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is known for being the site you inevitably arrive at when googling a coding question, and I have been passively using it for over 5 years. It’s an invaluable tool when trying to debug code and understand error messages.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that someone has probably got stuck in the same place as you before, and if they asked on Stack Overflow there is then a searchable solution ready and waiting online, as members of the community can post answers.</p>

<div id="my-first-question" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> My First Question</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been coding in Microsoft’s flavour of SQL. It has been over a year since I was last using it, and I started getting frustrated when a join wasn’t working as planned. I was ready to jump ship and wrangle the data in R instead, but that wasn’t really the right solution as it would be complicating the matter if a colleague came to run the code.</p>
<p>After not being able to google my way to a solution, I took a deep breath and posted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59066778/t-sql-choosing-single-row-dependent-on-column-condition-and-frequency-in-table">my first question</a> onto Stack Overflow:</p>

<div id="the-response" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> The Response</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Within a minute, I had a (potentially automated) question asking what I had tried already. I updated my question accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Within 10 minutes, someone posted a solution. This solution pointed out an incompleteness in my toy example. I updated my question accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Within 2 hours, and a few conversation threads, 3 solutions had been posted. There was one I preferred, but all answered the question as I had posed it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I was impressed by two things in my response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone was respectful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is surprising as it is, after all, the internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People wanted to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes there may be incentives within the points structure of the site, but these were friendly experts giving me a free helping hand.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>I do not usually post on the internet, for fear of a negative experience. However, this first posting on Stack Overflow was an entirely positive experience. Who knows, one day I may even be posting solutions on the site…</p>
