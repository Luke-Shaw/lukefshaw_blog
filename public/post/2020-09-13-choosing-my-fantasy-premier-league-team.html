<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Intro</h1>
<p>This weekend the Premier League kicked-off for the 2020/21 season. This means Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is also back, the game of picking players from across the league into a fictional team, and how they perform in real life corresponds to the points they get.</p>
<p>This year, I have chosen to do some data visualisation to chose my team. This blog details my rough-and-ready approach.</p>

<p>Football is immensely complicated, and as so much money is made through the game there are clearly cutting-edge techniques being applied to get as much of an edge in quantifying the incredible uncertainty.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the hours spent putting this together and thinking about data in combination with a subject I enjoy.</p>
<p>My downfall this year is most likely to be the same as every year, which is losing interest and forgetting to update my team each week. To combat that I have signed-up to calendar notifications for the gameweek deadlines, but realistically it will probably still happen.</p>
<p>The next steps would be to work on a methodology for picking the starting 11 each week, and deciding how to use the one transfer per gameweek. There are also 3 wildcard options to consider.</p>
