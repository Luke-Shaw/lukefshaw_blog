A flavour of my professional career is here as opposed to a full CV, though one can be made available on request.

# Coding

Frankly, I love coding in R. Since January of 2014, I have coded in R wherever possible. Some of the things I have used R to do:
* *Statistical modelling* such as Baysesian computations, clustering, and GLMs
* *Data visualisation* using ggplot2 and the tidyverse world
* *Website creation*... this website!
* *Package building* as part of a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)

I have also been involved in data science projects where I have coded in python, and frequently use SQL and Git in combination with R.

# Work

Since October 2017 I have worked as a member of the Government Statistical Service, in statistical and data science roles across 3 government organisations.
