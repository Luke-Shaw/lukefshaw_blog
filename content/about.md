## About 

Hi. I'm a statistician / data scientist /  analyst (order not relevant) working for the UK Government. 



This website is a home for internet stuff I do relating to statistics and data. I like the language R, but we have an open(source) relationship.

I decided to make this website, using the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), after attending the [EARL](https://earlconf.com/) 2018 and [RSS](http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Events/RSS_Conference/RSS/Events/RSS_Conference.aspx?) 2019 conferences. The website theme is [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin).
